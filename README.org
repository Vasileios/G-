#+Title: G++ openGL and GLUT frameworks

This is an example of core graphics on Emacs - c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin17.2.0

The files you need to compile and build a graphics programm in C is:

 - line.c
 - line.o
 - makefile

Open emacs and run =C-x c= to make run the .c file.

Make sure you use an editor that keeps =tabs= as =tabs= and not
spaces.
